# high-seas-v1 
## You know that feeling when it starts to snow? You try to catch every individual snowflake that you can with your tounge because 
* A. It tastes good
* B. It feels good
* C. Because why not?

### In this game, I incorporated a randomizer which causes the snowflakes to slowly fall down, with a function that counts how many snowflakes you caught on your tongue. 
### If you can avoid anything thats NOT a snowflake, you can advance through 3 levels, which each have different obstacles. Make it through all the  way and add your score onto the leaderboard
### There is a timer on the top right that will motivate you to catch as many snowflakes as you can before the time is up
### Play this addicting game today! 
### 6 levels ! Each have more obstacles and increasing difficulty !
